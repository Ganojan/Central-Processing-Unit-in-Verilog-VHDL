# Central-Processing-Unit-in-Verilog-VHDL
This repository contains the implementation of a simple Central Processing Unit (CPU) designed using Verilog and VHDL. Utilising important components of digital logic, including latches, a Moore FSM, ALU, decoder, and seven-segment displays, I was able to create a simple CPU that performs basic arithmetic and logical functions.
